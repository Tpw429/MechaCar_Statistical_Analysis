# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this repository, I will be exploring MechaCar data vs Competitors to see who has the edge in certain aspects. During this project, I worked with excel files (csv) and loaded them into R and Rstudio to run analysis. The results of my project will be explained below.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Question 1: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
-

Question 2: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
-

Question 3: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- My R-squared value predicted the mpg of MechaCar prototypes correctly 71.49% of the time. This mean nearly 28.5% if failed. Although it is almost 3/4 of the way effective, I would not feel comfortable setting this model forward. There are other factors/variable that could greatly increase the effectiveness of our R-sqaured value. There are probably many variables we do not have access to which would increase our model effectiveness. A figure showing my R-squared value is shown below.
